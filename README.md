## 2. Project Summary

> **Device Description**
> Wanda Lock is an intelligent door lock which is easy-to-use, cheap but still maintains security.
>
> Internet Usage:
> Wanda Lock has 3 different interfaces for 3 kinds of users: Guests, Owner, Administrators
> 
> a. Guests
>  Guests can send personal information to owner's interface such as name, password and email.
>
> b. Owner
>  Owner can see guests information, then can decide whether to open the lock and whether to store guests information into local database. Owner can be notified by sound when guests are coming and the lock is open/closed. The lock status is also indicated by a LED on the interface in case owner is not capable getting access to the sound notification.
>
> c. Administrators
> Administrators can use their interface to realize On-The-Air-Firmware-Update by simply pressing a button on the website. The update progress is shown on real time.
 
> **Inspiration**
> You might ask: there are so many smart lock on the markets, why do we want to design another one? 
>
> Designed for customers, price and functionality is what we focus on. 
> 
> Firstly, many smart locks on the market are over $200 just because they use cameras. However, Wanda Lock uses QR code reader to avoid driving the price too high.
>
> Secondly, is the functionality also correct and secure for users if it is so cheap? The answer is definitely yes. Wanda Lock requres user to provide email to receive a key of QR code. This helps to avoid the situation where people steal the name and password and can also open the lock. Using personal email for identification and security is a common strategy on the market, so using this instead of camera is an effective and cheap way to ensure secuirty.
